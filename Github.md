# Git - A guide on how to use git via the command line

Before I talk about git, I wanted to define a few key terms that I will be using in this guide. Any new vocabulary in the guide will be highlighted like `so`.

* `Version Control System` : A version control system, also known as a VCS, keeps tracks changes made to files. A VCS logs information about what changed, who changed it, and why it was changed.

* `Terminal` : A terminal is an interface in which you can type and execute text based commands. The terminal is very powerful and gives you direct control over a computing environment. 

* `Commands` : A command is a instruction to a computer program in order to perform a certain task. In other words, commands run programs. Keep in mind that a lot of commands run via a terminal cannot be undone. It is key to understand what you are exactly doing with a command before you execute it. 

## 1. What is Git? 

Well, now that we have covered our bases, let's talk about Git. It's important to note that `Git` and `Github` are two completely different systems. Git is a version control system. Github is a website for hosting (storing) projects that use git. I like to think of it in this way: Git is a tool and Github is like Google Drive. You can use git to "push" your projects to Github. 

So why use git? Well, git is useful for coordinating work among several people working on the same codebase. Changes are logged in checkpoints known as `commits`. And git is not just for programming. You can use it to track changes to an essay, or save multiple revisions of art. 

Before you move on to the rest of this guide, make sure you have git installed. Linux and MacOS systems have git installed by default, so you don't have to install anything. If you are windows, check out this [guide](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001927.htm#:~:text=By%20default%2C%20Git%20is%20installed,not%20include%20a%20Git%20command.)
